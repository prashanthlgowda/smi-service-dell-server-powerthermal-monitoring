Purpose
~~~~~~~

Power and Thermal Microservice collect power monitoring and consumption on compute node using industry standard WS-Management - WSMAN Protocol.

Power and Thermal monitoring for hardware resources in a datacenter environment is one of the major challenges for hardware administrator in converged and hyper converged environment. Administrators want to manage the power consumption by nodes or by rack.  
Setting power capping on an individual node or set of nodes will ensure the power consumption is under control and monitored. 
This Dell Server Power and Thermal Microservice will enable an administrator to monitor and manage power and thermal consumption by node or set of nodes within their racks.

The microservice is available at dockerhub as a docker image to download and run.
